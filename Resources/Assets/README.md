# TimeEngine Asset Library (Top-Down Template)

This directory contains modular assets for building a top-down game in TimeEngine.

## Folder Structure

- **`Characters/`**: Sprite sheets and animations.
  - `FuturisticExplorer_Spritesheet.png`: 4-directional walking animations.
- **`Tilesets/`**: Modular tiles for environment building.
- **`Items/`**: Collectibles, power-ups, and interactive objects.
- **`UI/`**: Game-specific UI elements (health bars, inventory slots).

## Integration Guide

1. **Sprite Sheets**: Use the texture sub-rects to define individual frames.
2. **Flipbooks**: Combine frame sub-rects into flipbooks for animation.
3. **Tilesets**: Designed for a grid-based tile-map system.

*Note: Some assets are currently being generated or require manual additions.*
