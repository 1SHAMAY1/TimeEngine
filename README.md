# ⏱️ TimeEngine

**TimeEngine** is a modular, custom C++ game engine built from scratch. It features a layered architecture, modern C++ practices, and is designed to support extensible components like custom logging, event systems, and rendering backends. This engine is ideal for learning low-level engine architecture or building scalable 2D/3D projects.
